# Project Luca

To anyone (at Hesiod or otherwise), welcome! This is the source code for the Luca Accounting tool, commissioned to the hLabs department of Hesiod Financial by the Hesiod Financial group. The goal of this tool is to create a centralized application to give all members of Hesiod Financial the ability to quickly and easily view finances and to also give specialized members of Hesiod the ability to deposit and withdraw funds for investments and miscellaneous operating expenses.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Your computer will need to have Python. A good explanation of how to do this is available on the [Python Website](python.org).

From there, you will need to install a few packages. To handle the website framework, you will need to download Django.

```
$ pip install Django
```

To handle the form tags used, install crispy-forms

```
$ pip install --upgrade django-crispy-forms
```

And lastly to handle the images, you will need Pillow

```
$ pip install Pillow
```

If you intend to check testing and coverage, make sure to install coverage as well

```
$ pip install coverage
```

## Built With

Python 3.6 with Django for Backend
